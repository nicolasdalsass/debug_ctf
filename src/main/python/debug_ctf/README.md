How to approach this list of challenges : 

01 is a sanity check - can you even run a python file ?

02, 04, 07, 08 and 10 are about standard usage of the debugger. They will take you through some of the menus and options
you have available.

Since a debugger is all about state - observing state and manipulating state, 03 and 06 and 09 are about that. In python, 
what really is the state of a program, and what can you change about it ?

05 is about discovering a bit of a builtin of Python : pdb. Very occasionally useful for when you want to local debug on a remote server.

All of those are known doable both in IntelliJ Ultimate and in VSCode vanilla. To my personal state, the debugging view
of IntelliJ is a lot more convenient than the VSCode one, however I'm seriously biased, so YMMV.
